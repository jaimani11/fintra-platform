# Fintra Platform (FintraOS + AgencyOS)

Fintra is an AI-native operating system for small and mid-sized businesses.

This repository contains:
- **Platform Core**: identity, orgs, licensing, billing, audit
- **AgencyOS**: AI Chief of Staff (decision preparation & execution)
- **Modules**: payroll, accounting, budgeting, sales tax, commissions, expenses
- **Frontend Portal**: unified admin center (Adobe/Microsoft-style)
- **Contracts**: API + event schemas
- **Testing**: deterministic scenarios for student validation

## Important
This is a **production-grade platform baseline**.

Students should:
- extend modules
- integrate APIs
- add intelligence
- test workflows

Students should NOT:
- redesign auth
- remove approval loops
- bypass audit or governance layers

## Philosophy
> Users don’t want more dashboards.  
> They want to know what needs attention.

That is the role of AgencyOS.
