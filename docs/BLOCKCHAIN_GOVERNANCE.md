# Blockchain Governance Mode

Blockchain is used ONLY for governance integrity.

What it does:
- hashes approved decisions
- anchors hashes on-chain
- provides tamper-evident audit trails

What it does NOT do:
- move money
- issue tokens
- replace databases

Governance mode is optional and off by default.
