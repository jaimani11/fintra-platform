# Cross-Module Intelligence

Fintra does not treat business functions as silos.

AgencyOS correlates signals across:
- payroll
- commissions
- equity
- cash
- compliance

This enables:
- early detection of second-order risks
- better executive judgment
- fewer surprises

This is the defining capability of the platform.
